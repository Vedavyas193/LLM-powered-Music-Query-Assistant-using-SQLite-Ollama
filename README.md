LLM-Powered Music Intelligence Assistant using SQLite, LangChain & LangGraph

MuseBot is a music data retrieval system that allows users to query a large songs dataset using natural language.
It converts user questions into SQL queries, executes them on a SQLite database, and returns structured responses using a Large Language Model (LLM).

This project compares three different architectures for LLM-based data retrieval:

Deterministic Pipeline

Tool-based SQL Agent

LangGraph + Agent Architecture
